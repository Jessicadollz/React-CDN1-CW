                    Welcome to the MDN learning area. This set of articles aims to provide complete <br />
                    beginners to web development with fundamental skills for coding websites.

                    The aim is not to take you from "beginner" to "expert" but to <br />
                    take you from "beginner" to "comfortable." From there, you should be able to start <br />
                    making your way, learning from <a href='https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/'>the rest of MDN</a>, and other intermediate to <br />
                    advanced resources that assume a lot of previous knowledge.

                    If you are a complete beginner, web development can be challenging â€” we will hold <br />
                    your hand and provide enough detail for you to feel comfortable and learn the topics <br />
                    properly. You should feel at home whether you are a student learning web <br />
                    development (on your own or as part of a class), a teacher looking for class <br />
                    materials, a hobbyist, or someone who just wants to understand more about how <br />
                    web technologies work.
